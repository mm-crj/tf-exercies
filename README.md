## Chap 2: Regression

An end to end machine learning problem.
1. [California Housing Data](https://github.com/mm-crj/tf-exercies/tree/master/Regression/California%20housing) This explores the  problem of predicting housing prices from the given data set. Since we are predicting values this is a Regression problem. This is kind of a brief introduction to the whole process of data cleaning, processing, pipelines to model evaluation, ensemble, fine tuning hyper-parameters to finally testing and deploying the model.


## Chap3: Classification
We will be using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which is a set of 70,000 small
images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau for a Classification problem.
